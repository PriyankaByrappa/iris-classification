# 🌸 Iris Classification using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree

## 📌 Project Overview

This machine learning project focuses on classifying iris flower species (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*) based on their physical features. Two algorithms — **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** — are applied and evaluated for accuracy and performance.

The project is developed using **Python in Google Colab** with data visualization, model comparison, and accuracy evaluation.

## 📁 Dataset

- **File Name**: `iris.csv`  
- **Source**: Provided by internship / UCI ML Repository  
- **Attributes**:
  - `sepal length (cm)`
  - `sepal width (cm)`
  - `petal length (cm)`
  - `petal width (cm)`
  - `species` (Target variable)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Google Colab
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

---

## 📈 ML Models Used

### 1. Logistic Regression
- A linear model used for multi-class classification.
- Evaluated using accuracy and classification report.

### 2. Decision Tree Classifier
- A non-linear tree-based classifier.
- Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. Import and explore the dataset
2. Visualize features using seaborn/matplotlib
3. Split data into training and test sets
4. Train:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
5. Evaluate performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
6. Visualize confusion matrix using `seaborn`

## 📊 Results

| Model              | Accuracy |
|-------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | ~97%    |
| Decision Tree       | ~100%   |

*Note: Accuracy may vary slightly depending on random state or data split.*
